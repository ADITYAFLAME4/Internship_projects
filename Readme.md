_Work Done @Task1_

###### Calculator

Created a basic calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

###### Number Guessing game

_Work Done @Task2_

###### Rock, paper, scissors game

Created a program that allows users to play the classic game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer. The user will input their choice, and the computer will randomly select one of the three options. The program will then determine the winner based on the rules of the game and display the result. The game will continue until the user decides to stop playing.

_Work Done @Task3_



###### Tic Tac Toe Game

Developed a program that enables two players or one player and the cpu to play a game of tic tac toe. The program will display a 3x3 grid and allow players / cpu to take turns entering their moves. It will check for a win or a draw after each move and announce the result.

The game will continue until there is a winner or the grid is full. Players can restart the game or exit after each round.

_Work Done @Task4_

###### Snake Game

To develop a snake game:

Created a program where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. Initially, the snake starts with a single segment and grows in length each time it eats food randomly placed on the screen. The player uses arrow keys to navigate the snake. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen. Also exported the program into executable so that anyone can play the game on the go.
At the end while the game is over it will show high score along with the current score.
I have came to know that how to use awt and swing in java which I had previously no knowledge on!
Note: The highscore is random, it cannot hold previous highest value.

**FutureIntern_JD_05**

_Work Done @Task5_

###### Random Password Generator

Created a program that generates random passwords based on criteria defined by the user, such as length and complexity (e.g., including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters). The user inputs the desired length and selects the types of characters to include. The program then generates and displays a random password meeting these specifications, ensuring strong security and usability.

Also this program can generate its own string of password if all the parameters are given to it, at the same time user can give their own string preference to generate the string!
